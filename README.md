- The virtual keyboard is able to switch between two language layouts (English + any other language).
- The buttons on the virtual keyboard display symbols of a selected language.
- The application saves a chosen language after the page is reloaded and displays the keyboard on that language.
- Keystrokes are animated.
- Clicks on the buttons with a mouse on the virtual keyboard and pressing keys on a physical keyboard input symbols to the text area located on the page above the virtual keyboard:
    - pressing the `Up`, `Down`, `Left` or `Right` arrow key inputs an arrow symbol in the input field, or implements navigation on the text area.
    - pressing the `Enter` should move a text cursor to the next line
    - the `Tab` key creates a horizontal indent
    - pressing the rest of the function keys on a keyboard does not result in inputting symbols
    - the `Backspace` key removes character before the text cursor
    - the `Del` key removes character after the text cursor
    - the `Shift`, `Alt`, `Ctrl`, `Caps lock` and `Space` keys should work as on a real keyboard
